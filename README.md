# WBSM4
This repository utilizes Java to implement fundamental operations for matrices over the binary field, including matrix inversion, rank computation, matrix multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, and the generation of random invertible matrices. These functionalities facilitate the construction of white-box implementations. As an example, this project has implemented the Xiao-Lai white-box SM4 scheme based on the aforementioned matrix operations, solely for the purpose of research into white-box cryptographic security.
